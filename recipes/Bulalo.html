    <h3><em>Description</em></h3>
    <p>Bulalo is a light colored soup that is enriched as it is cooked
        with potatoes, beef shank and bone marrow for a few hours,
        until a large part of the collagen and fat have melted in 
        this clear broth. Seasonings vary from chef to chef. 
        Some will put a lot of black pepper, while others will
         use patis, bay leaves or garlic.</p>
