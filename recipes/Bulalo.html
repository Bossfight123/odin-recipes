    <h3><em>Description</em></h3>
    <p>Bulalo is a light colored soup that is enriched as it is cooked
        with potatoes, beef shank and bone marrow for a few hours,
        until a large part of the collagen and fat have melted in 
        this clear broth. Seasonings vary from chef to chef. 
        Some will put a lot of black pepper, while others will
         use patis, bay leaves or garlic.</p>
    <h3><em>Ingredients</em></h3>
    <ul>
    <li>2 beef marrow bones</li>
    <li>1 pound beef shank</li>
    <li>1 onion</li>
    <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons patis and salt</li>
    <li>2 cobs corn</li>
    <li>3 baby bok choy</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><em>Steps</em></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, soak the brisket in water to draw out blood. Refrigerate until ready to use.</li>
        <li>Rinse the beef bone marrow and then place in a pot and fill with enough water 
            to cover. Bring to a boil over high heat then lower the heat to let it simmer for 5 minutes to let the scums out.</li>
        <li>Drain and discard the water and clean the pot. Rinse the bones again to make sure no scum is left.</li>
        <li>Return the beef marrow to the clean pot and fill with 8-10 cups of water to cover. Bring to a boil over high heat. 
            Once it boils cover the pot and reduce heat to achieve a medium boil. Let it boil for an hour or 30 minutes if using pressure cooker.</li>
        <li>Add the soaked brisket (water drained), fish sauce, onion, the white part of onion leek, and peppercorns. Boil until 
            meat is fork-tender, about 1.5 to 2 hours more or 30 minutes if using a pressure cooker. Add more water if needed to 
            cover the meat.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat off to let the fat settle on the surface. Skim off most of the fats then turn the heat back on and bring to a gentle boil.</li>
        <li>Add the potatoes and cook for 10 minutes or until tender. Then add the corn and cabbage and cook for 3-5 minutes. 
            Lastly, add the green part of the onion leeks and salt if still needed then turn off the heat.</li>
        <li>Transfer to serving bowls.</li>
    </ol>
